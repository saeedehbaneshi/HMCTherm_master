## 2. About HMCTherm

  HMCTherm is a comprehensive simulation framework for Stacked-Memory-on-CPU architecture. Given the architectural description of multi-core CPUs and HMCs, HMCTherm can simulate the 3D thermal profile (both transient and static) of the HMC when a certain program is running. The HMCTherm is built based on CasHMC v1.2 (https://github.com/estwings57/CasHMC) which takes memory traces as inputs and performs cycle-accurate simulation of HMC to get the delay, power and thermal information.  

  A grid-based thermal solver is integrated to HMCTherm which is based on SuperLU\_MT (http://crd-legacy.lbl.gov/~xiaoye/SuperLU/). SuperLU is a general purpose library for the direct solution of large, sparse, nonsysmmetric systems of linear equations; and SuperLU\_MT is a version that enables multi-threaded computation. 


## 3. Folder Directory
  - sources : source files for the HMC simulator 
  - Example : containing memory traces for the simulation
  - script : containing python scripts for ploting final power and thermal profiles

## 4. Usage 

### Dependency
  The integrated grid-based thermal solver is based on SuperLU\_MT. SuperLU\_MT should be installed before installing HMCTemp. SuperLU\_MT can be downloaded from http://crd-legacy.lbl.gov/~xiaoye/SuperLU/ and following the instruction to install the library. 

### Installation
  - (1) install the architectural simulator 
  ```
  $ cd multi2sim_memtrace
  $ make
  ```
  - (2) install McPAT
  ```
  $ cd McPAT
  $ make
  ```
  - (3) in the Makefile for the HMC simulator (under the root directory of HMCTherm), modify the SuperLUroot to where the SuperLU is installed in your local system 

  - (4) install the HMC simulator 
  ``` 
  $ make 
  ```
### Run your Simulation
   - (1) run the HMC simulator
   ``` 
   $ cd $(HMCThermROOT)/
   $ ./HMCTherm -c 400000 -t file -f ./Example/SPEC_CPU2006_example/mase_trace_bwaves_base.alpha.v0.trc -x 1024 -y 1024 -e 20000 -d ./ 
   ```
   In this command: <br /> 
      **-c** indicates the number of CPU cycles to be simulated <br /> 
      **-t** indicates whether the input memory trace is from a file (file) or generated randomly (random) <br />
      **-f** if the memory trace is from a file, the trace file name is specified here <br />
      **-x** and **-y** specifies the size (in byte) of a "mat" which is the smallest unit of memory [Default 512] <br />
      **-e** is the time step to print out the transient temperature and power profile <br /> 
      **-d** specifies the directory saving the output files <br />
      **-h** will print out the help of the HMC simulator <br /> 

   The HMC simulation will generate five output files: <br />
      - **/result/file.out** : summary of the HMC latency <br /> 
      - **temperature\_trace.csv** : the temperature traces for each time step <br /> 
      - **power\_trace.csv** : the power traces for each time step <br />
      - **Average_power.csv** : the average power profile within the time of simulation <br />
      - **static_temperature.csv** : the static thermal profile given the average power <br />

   - (2) Plot the power and temperature profile using the python scripts in $(HMCThermROOT)/script/
     - plot_trans.py : plot the transient power or temperature profile 
     - plot_staticT.py : plot the static temperature profile
     - plot_staticP.py : plot the average power profile
